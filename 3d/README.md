# Solid Models

This directory contains the solid models for the 3D printed parts of the
project. The models are designed in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/).

## Parts

The following parts are included:

* `programming_jig.scad` - A jig to hold the PCB in place while programming (using a modified [3x2 pogo pin clip](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003705632078.html)).
* `tracker_case.scad` - A case for holding the tracker PCB and battery.
* `tracker_case_lid.scad` - A lid for the tracker case.

## Notes

The lid and case of the tracker are affixed using four 2.9x6.5mm self-tapping screws.

To waterproof the tracker case I basically coated the entire assembly (and lid mating surface) in a layer of two-part silicone rubber. You could print the tracker out of resin but you'd have to design some kind of gasket (perhaps in a future revision).
